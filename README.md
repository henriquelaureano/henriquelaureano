### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Statistician | Biostatistician | Data Scientist based in [Curitiba](https://goo.gl/K1Qcdv) and working in the [Pele Pequeno PrÃ­ncipe Research Institute](http://www.pelepequenoprincipe.org.br/), part of the Pequeno PrÃ­ncipe Complex. Pequeno PrÃ­ncipe Hospital is the largest exclusively pediatric hospital in Latin America.

I hold a BSc in Statistics (2016) and an MSc in Statistics and Numerical Methods in Engineering (2021), both @ [UFPR](https://goo.gl/DtVAbi). In the masters, I handled mainly multivariate failure time data (also known as multivariate survival data). You may take a look [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/thesis/thesis.pdf) at my thesis and [here ](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.pdf)( [.Rmd](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.Rmd) | [in_header file](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/beamerheader.txt) | [TikZ style](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/tikzit.sty)) at the defense slides.

My main research interests lie in computational statistics and data analysis, under statistical modeling frameworks if the goal is to understand some process or machine learning frameworks if the goal is prediction/forecasting. Besides all that, I love to analyze data and make pretty and useful visualizations (I ensembled some [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/visualizations)).

You can learn more about me on my [page](https://henriquelaureano.github.io).
