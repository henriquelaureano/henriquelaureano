### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist based in [Curitiba](https://goo.gl/K1Qcdv) and working in the Volvo Trucks & Buses, more specifically at the Advanced Analytics team.

I hold a BSc in Statistics (2016) and an MSc in Statistics and Numerical Methods in Engineering (2021), both @ [UFPR](https://goo.gl/DtVAbi). In the masters, I handled mainly multivariate failure time data (also known as multivariate survival / confiability data). You may take a look [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/thesis/thesis.pdf) at my thesis and [here ](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.pdf)( [.Rmd](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.Rmd) | [in_header file](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/beamerheader.txt) | [TikZ style](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/tikzit.sty)) at the defense slides.

My main interests lie in computational statistics and data analysis, under statistical modeling frameworks if the goal is to understand some process or machine learning frameworks if the goal is prediction / forecasting. Besides all that, I love to make pretty and useful visualizations (I ensembled some [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/visualizations)).

You can learn more about me on my [page](https://henriquelaureano.github.io).
