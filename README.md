### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Statistical Data Scientist based in [Curitiba](https://goo.gl/K1Qcdv).

I hold a BSc in Statistics and an MSc in Statistics and Numerical Methods in Engineering, both @ [UFPR](https://goo.gl/DtVAbi). You may take a look [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/thesis/thesis.pdf) at my thesis and [here ](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.pdf)( [.Rmd](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.Rmd) | [in_header file](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/beamerheader.txt) | [TikZ style](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/tikzit.sty)) at the defense slides.

My main interests lie in computational statistics and data analysis. I also like to make some pretty and useful visualizations - I ensembled some [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/visualizations).

You can learn more about me on my [page](https://henriquelaureano.github.io).
