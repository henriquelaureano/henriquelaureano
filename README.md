### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Statistician based in [Curitiba](https://goo.gl/K1Qcdv) and working in the [Pele Pequeno PrÃ­ncipe Research Institute](http://www.pelepequenoprincipe.org.br/),
part of the Pequeno PrÃ­ncipe Complex. Pequeno PrÃ­ncipe Hospital is the largest exclusively pediatric hospital in Latin America.

I hold a BSc in Statistics (2016) and an MSc in Statistical Methods/Numerical Methods in Engineering (2021), both @ [UFPR](https://goo.gl/DtVAbi). In the masters, I 
handled mainly multivariate survival data through multinomial GLMMs. You may take a look [here](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/thesis/thesis.pdf) at my
thesis and [here ](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.pdf)( [.Rmd](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/slides.Rmd) |
                                                                               [in_header file](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/beamerheader.txt) |
                                                                               [TikZ style](https://henriquelaureano.github.io/THESIS/aqua/tikzit.sty)) at the 
defense slides.

My main research interests lie in computational statistics and statistical modeling through GLMMs, estimation equations, and bayesian and likelihood-based methods.
Besides the theoretical background, I love to analyze data and make pretty and useful visualizations.
